  I believe in this modern computer programming has the power to change a lot of lives, also  anybody with a passion for creating software

  can learn how to code. 

  So far I have a fair amount of  experience  in coding in  JavaScript, Css3, HTML5, bootstrap, Sass and react.js. I played around with  react. js, mocha and chai testing framework.

  My interests besides coding are type-racing,reading blogs preferably on medium.com, and playing chess
